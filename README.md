# Pizza Sales Analytics üçïüìä

This project involves a comprehensive SQL analysis of pizza sales data, aimed at uncovering key insights into customer preferences, order patterns, and revenue generation. By leveraging SQL queries, the analysis explores various factors influencing pizza sales and provides actionable recommendations to optimize business performance.

## Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed pizza sales data to answer questions related to:
1. **Total orders and revenue generated**
2. **Popular pizza types and sizes**
3. **Ordering patterns throughout the day**
4. **Category-wise distribution of pizza sales**

## Files Included
- **queries/**
  - `basic_analysis.sql`: Contains SQL queries for basic analysis, including total orders, revenue, and most popular pizza sizes.
  - `intermediate_analysis.sql`: Includes queries to analyze order frequency by hour and quantity ordered by category.
  - `advanced_analysis.sql`: Advanced queries focused on revenue contributions and identifying top-performing pizzas.
- **presentation/**
  - `Pizza_Sales_Analytics.pdf`: A presentation summarizing the key findings, insights, and recommendations from the analysis.

## Key Insights
- **Popular Categories**: Classic and Supreme pizzas are among the most frequently ordered categories.
- **Peak Ordering Times**: Orders tend to peak around certain hours, providing opportunities for targeted promotions.
- **Top Revenue Contributors**: Certain pizza types and sizes significantly contribute to overall revenue, helping in optimizing the product mix.
